| the short term. (dwr-24-10.pdf p.9) | The energy sector is closely linked to the industry sector, as both are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and rely on each other for energy production and consumption. In France, the industry sector is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for around 30 percent of total emissions. The energy sector, specifically the production of electricity and heat, accounts for around 21 percent of total emissions. The report highlights that France's strategy for reducing emissions in the industry sector includes electrifying heating systems and banning technologies with high emissions. However, the recent trend has been dynamic, with the share of renewable energy in energy consumption rising from 21.4 percent in 2021 to 21.8 percent in 2022, suggesting that a turnaround in the industry sector's emissions trend is possible.

The energy and industry sectors are closely interconnected in the context of France's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
