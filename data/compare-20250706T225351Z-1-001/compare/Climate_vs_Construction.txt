| The study also shows that the carbon footprint of high-income households is significantly higher than that of low-income households. High-income households emit around 10 tons of CO2 equivalents per capita per year, while low-income households emit around 3 tons. This difference is primarily due to transport behavior, with air travel being the main driver. However, the study also highlights that residential energy use and nutrition contribute to the carbon footprint, with high-income households having larger housing spaces and consuming more meat. To reach the two-degree target, only three tons of CO2e per capita per year may be emitted. This means that individual efforts, such as simplifying housing swaps and energy-efficient renovations, as well as political measures, such as an animal welfare levy and a ban on short flights, are necessary to reduce emissions. The study also emphasizes the importance of accurate data and transparency in calculating emissions, as well as the need for international cooperation to address the global challenge of climate change.
