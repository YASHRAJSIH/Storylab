Paragraph:
The European Union's (EU) efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the Emission Trading System (ETS) and other policies have significant implications for labor markets and households. According to the authors of a study, a carbon price of 65 euros per ton including VAT in 2026 would result in an additional cost of 17.9 cents per liter for E10 and 20.5 cents per liter for diesel for consumers. However, the EU's emission caps and the introduction of an emissions trading system for buildings and road transport sectors could potentially lead to efficiency gains and cost savings for some groups. The study suggests that the climate dividend, which is the revenue generated from the sale of emission allowances, should be paid to all households to offset these costs. The distribution of the climate dividend could be achieved through wage and income taxes for above-average and high-income earners, ensuring that the burden of the carbon pricing is not disproportionately borne
