Energy and finance are intricately connected in the economic landscape, as evidenced by the findings in the reports. The reports suggest that energy prices significantly impact inflation, which in turn influences economic development. For instance, high energy prices contribute to a loss of purchasing power and can hinder economic growth. Conversely, fiscal transfers between coalition members can enhance the punitive power of cooperative sanctions, as demonstrated by the upper limit of the punitive power achievable through tradesanctions. Furthermore, fiscal policy stimuli, such as those implemented in China, can significantly contribute to global growth. The reports also highlight the role of fiscal policy in supporting consumption and investments, which can impact the real estate sector and overall economic development. Lastly, the reports discuss the importance of decarbonizing activities in emission-intensive sectors, which can be influenced by fiscal policies and thresholds set by taxonomies. Overall, the reports underscore the importance of considering the interplay between energy and finance in economic analysis and policymaking. (d
