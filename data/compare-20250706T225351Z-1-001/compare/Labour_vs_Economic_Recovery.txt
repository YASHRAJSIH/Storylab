Labour and economic recovery in Germany are intricately connected as the economic situation remains uncertain and characterized by subdued growth and high unemployment. Despite this, investments in equipment are projected to increase towards the end of the forecast horizon, primarily due to defense spending. This expansionary stimulus, along with the recovery in the manufacturing industry, is expected to boost imports and contribute to a slightly negative trade balance. At the same time, real wages have finally started to increase, providing a much-needed boost to private consumption. The recovery of the global economy, particularly in advanced economies, is also expected to support the German economy's momentum. Overall, the connection between labour and economic recovery is evident
