| The labor market situation is characterized by a highdegree of uncertainty and a considerable need for major restructuring in the industry. This is particularly evident in the construction industry, where the number of newly built residences is unlikely to increase significantly. In many cases, it will be crucial for the success of internal restructuring for workers to receive wage replacement benefits. However, the economic situation remains subdued and characterized by uncertainty about economic developments. With weak global industrial production, repeated interest rate hikes by the European Central Bank, and high inflation rates dampening domestic demand, the trade balance for intermediate goods is unlikely to make a significant contribution to German exports. Despite the weak economic situation, employment reached an all-time high with an annual average of 45.9 million people in 2023. However, the continuing slowdown in price momentum and the recovery in foreign industrial production are unlikely to make a key contribution to this. The manufacturing industry is likely to recover somewhat, supported by an increase in the labor volume, which itself will be supported by the continuous increase in employment
