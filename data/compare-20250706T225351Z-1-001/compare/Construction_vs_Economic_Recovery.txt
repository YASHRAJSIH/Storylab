| The German government is planning to introduce a levy on flights departing from German airports in 2025. This levy is intended to generate revenue for climate protection measures and to reduce the number of flights. The revenue generated from the levy is expected to amount to around 1.2 billion euros per year. The levy is also intended to provide incentives for the expansion of rail transport and the reduction of heavy meat consumption. The levy is expected to have a positive impact on the carbon footprint of the German economy.
