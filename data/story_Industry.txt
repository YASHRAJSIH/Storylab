Paragraph 1 (Past):
The industrial sector in Germany has faced numerous challenges in the past. According to a report by the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), the production potential in the industry was only utilized to the extent of 82.5% on average between 2015 and 2019. This underutilization can be attributed to various factors, including the role of supervisory and executive boards, the influence of CEOs, and the presence of women in the finance industry. Additionally, industry was hit hard by flashpoints such as the war in Ukraine.

Paragraph 2 (Present):
The current state of the industrial sector in Germany is characterized by a significant shift towards the service sector. The energy and food industries are expected to account for 3% of nominal production potential on average between 2020 and 2025. However, the construction sector is unlikely to see a significant increase in the number of newly built residences. According to a report by the DIW, the industrial sector requires major restructuring in its capacity utilization.

Paragraph 3 (Future):
Looking ahead, the global economy's boost will increase foreign demand for German production, but the flooding in southern Germany will dampen industrial production. Additionally, the increase in tariffs on Chinese goods by 10% and the reduction in US production by 0.4 percentage points by the end of the year will further impact the sector. Figure 5 illustrates the split evolution of the industrial and services sectors, with the industrial sector expected to decline in relative terms.
