Paragraph 1 (Past):
DIW Berlin, a renowned German economic research institute, has long specialized in the economic analysis of the euro area. Fritz Kurcz, an economist at DIW Berlin, has been a key figure in this field, contributing significantly to research in areas such as international economics (JEL: E32), macroeconomics (JEL: E66), and monetary economics (JEL: F01) (dwr-24-35.pdf p.17).

Paragraph 2 (Present):
Currently, the Macroeconomics Department at DIW Berlin is led by Geraldine Dany-Knedlik, with Laura Pagenhardt and Marie Rullière serving as Research Associates. Additionally, Nina Maria Brehl is a Doctoral Student, all focusing on the euro area economy (dwr-24-35.pdf p.17). Their research contributes to the understanding of the economic dynamics and challenges of the euro area.

Paragraph 3 (Future):
Looking ahead, the labor market in the euro area is expected to face challenges due to population aging. The labor force participation rate (lar) is projected to decline as a result. However, the European Central Bank (ECB) aims to maintain a two-percent inflation target. Thus, the inflation expectation will play a crucial role in achieving this goal. By the next decade, the euro area is expected to reach the two-percent target (dwr-24-35.pdf p.16).
