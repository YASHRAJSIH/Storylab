Paragraph 1 (Past):
Europe's economic history is marked by significant fiscal policy shifts. The German Department at DIW Berlin, represented by hengerer and ahackmann, has extensively studied German fiscal policy, including its foreign aspects. Fiscal measures have played a crucial role in shaping the country's economic landscape. For instance, the general government budget burdens and relief have been instrumental in managing economic fluctuations.

Paragraph 2 (Present):
Currently, fiscal policy is overall restrictive, contributing to a rising structural deficit. The energy crisis and expiring relief measures are major factors. However, some fiscal policies, such as emissions trading, continue to support the general government budget. The budget impact of these measures is dampening on economic activity.

Paragraph 3 (Future):
Looking ahead, the expansive fiscal policy measures implemented during the crisis will have a more substantial impact than future spending increases on the economy. Households and other actors will experience varying effects, with some benefiting and others negatively affected. Overall, fiscal policy measures are expected to lower household income and reduce investment activity, leading to restrictive stimuli.
