Paragraph 1: (Past)
The construction sector in Germany experienced a significant decline in the late 1990s and early 2000s. According to the data from the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), the construction sector's contribution to GDP shrank by 0.4 percentage points between 1997 and 2000 (dwr-24-35.pdf p.16). This decline was mainly due to the housing benefits reform, which led to a decrease in housing demand and, consequently, a decline in residential construction (-0.9 percentage points, dwr-24-35.pdf p.15). Additionally, the reduction in financial support for social housing construction further impacted the sector negatively (-0.7 percentage points, dwr-24-35.pdf p.15).

Paragraph 2: (Present)
The construction industry in Germany is currently facing challenges, particularly in the areas of cost and densification. According to a study by the German Institute for Construction Economics (DIW), the same price changes are assumed for civil engineering and non-residential building construction due to a lack of detailed information on price developments in civil engineering (dwr-24-01.pdf p.13). However, some sectors of the construction industry, such as structural engineering, are experiencing a negative impact, which is having a ripple effect on other construction-related services (dwr-24-01.pdf p.13).

Paragraph 3: (Future)
The future of the construction sector in Germany looks uncertain due to the continuing decline in new residential construction and the impact of the Federal Constitutional Court ruling on funding. According to a report
