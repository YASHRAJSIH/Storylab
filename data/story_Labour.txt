Paragraph 1 (Past):
In the past, labor restructuring measures aimed to provide wage replacement benefits to workers whose jobs were being phased out due to technological advancements or the relocation of industries. However, these measures came at a cost, with smaller shares of wage increases going to workers compared to the upper echelons of employment. Social security also played a role, providing a safety net for those who lost their jobs during this transition.

Paragraph 2 (Present):
The present labor market is characterized by a higher price level, which has become permanently higher. Unemployment, defined as the percentage of the civilian labor force, currently stands at 5.7%. The increase in employment in the public sector is likely to support the labor market, but the correlation between employment rate and unemployment rate is not statistically significant.

Paragraph 3 (Future):
Looking forward, unemployment is expected to peak at 6.0% in the future, particularly in areas of health and care services. The continuous increase in employment in the private sector will help mitigate this trend. The wage level is projected to increase by 1.4% in 2024, providing some relief for workers.
